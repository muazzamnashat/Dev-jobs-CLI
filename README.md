# Job Search-CLI

## What is Job Search-CLI

Job Search CLI uses the GitHub Jobs API and shows software engineering jobs according to the user preferred location and programming language. First, it prints a list of available job locations depending on the currently active job listings on GitHub. Users can choose a location and then it will show a list of programming languages mentioned on those job listings. Users can select any programming language and it will show the job listings without the job descriptions. Job descriptions are deliberately hidden from the list because it will make the printout looks messy. But users can select a job number to read the description.
